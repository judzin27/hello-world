# hello-world
Following the tutorial

So I am starting my programming journey for like fifth time over. 

Who knows will I stick to it. But every time I try I learn someting new that stays in my head even after I quit.
I think that is part of the reason that I keep coming back to programming even though I am not any good, really.
